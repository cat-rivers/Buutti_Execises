info:
    age numbers from students: 24, 19, 32, 55, 26


a) algorithm that calculates average age of participants(natural language)

    add ages in group
    divide sum by the number of participants

b) pseudocode version


    ages of participants = [24, 19, 32, 55, 26]
    average age of participants(ages){
        sum = add the ages and get total sum
        amount=  get the number participants
        division = divide sum by amount(sum/amount)
    }

c) pseudocode using loops

sum = 0
for each number in [24, 19, 32, 55, 26]{
    add to sum 
    until it goes through the list of ages
}
divide the sum by amount of participants
